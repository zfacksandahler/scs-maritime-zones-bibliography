# Collaborative and Verifiable Annotated Bibliography: Paracel & Spratly Islands

## Project Purpose

This repository serves as a foundational resource for a hypothetical upper-level university seminar on maritime sovereignty, focusing on the geolegal and geopolitical status of the **Paracel Islands** (Xisha Islands) and **Spratly Islands** (Nansha Islands) in the South China Sea.

The goal is to construct a shared, structured, and peer‑reviewed bibliography of key documents—international court rulings, academic articles, national legislation, UN documents, historical maps, and other primary/secondary sources—that illuminate the complex maritime disputes in the region.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Workflow Overview

1. **New Source Submission**: Each contributor (student) opens a new issue using the "New Source Submission" template, providing a complete citation, URL/DOI, source type, geographical focus, topical tag, and a brief summary.

2. **Curation**: The instructor assigns each student a peer's submission. The curator verifies the source, refines the summary, and adds the entry to the master bibliography (`sources/bibliography.md`) via a dedicated branch and pull request.

3. **Peer Review**: The instructor reviews the pull request, checking for accuracy, formatting, and adherence to style guidelines. Once approved, the change is merged into the main branch.

### Formatting Requirements

- **Citations**: Use the Chicago Manual of Style (17th edition) author‑date format.
- **Summary**: 2–3 concise sentences that capture the source's main argument, evidence, or relevance to the seminar themes.
- **Tags**: Choose from the predefined categories for **Geographical Focus** and **Primary Topical Tag** (see the issue template).

## Bibliography Structure

The master bibliography is maintained as a Markdown table in [`sources/bibliography.md`](sources/bibliography.md). The table columns are:

| Citation (Chicago author‑date) | Source Type | Geographical Focus | Key Summary | Contributor |
|-------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| *Entries will be added through the collaborative workflow* | | | | |
